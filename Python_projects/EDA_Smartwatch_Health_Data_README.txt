# README - Exploratory Data Analysis on Smartwatch Health Data

## Project Overview
This project applies exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to analyze and visualize smartwatch health data. Using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project will clean, prepare, analyze, and visualize data from a dataset of health metrics collected by a smartwatch.

## Project Objectives
1. Select a dataset from a recommended website.
2. Collaborate in a group setting to design and develop the project.
3. Apply NumPy and Pandas libraries to clean, prepare, and analyze data.
4. Use Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to visualize data.
5. Merge analyzed and visualized data to summarize findings and present them.

## Dataset Selection
- **Dataset URL:** [Smartwatch Health Data (Uncleaned)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammedarfathr/smartwatch-health-data-uncleaned)
- **Total Rows:** 10,000
- **Total Columns:** 7
- **Use Case:** Health monitoring using smartwatch sensor data

## Workflow
### 1. Dataset Selection
- **Action:** Select a dataset from the following recommended websites:
  - [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?fileType=csv)
  - **Restriction:** Focus on datasets related to Computer Science or Health.

### 2. Data Cleaning and Preparation
- **Action:** Develop a strategy to clean and prepare the data.
  - Handle missing data, duplicate, and invalid values.
  - Merge datasets, delete unnecessary columns, and add calculated columns or date conversions.
  - Ensure the dataset has at least 5 columns and 500 rows.

### 3. Data Analysis and Visualization
- **Action:** Conduct data analysis by exploring the following questions:
  1. How do heart rate variations correlate with different activities?
  2. Does blood oxygen level fluctuate differently for active vs. sedentary individuals?
  3. Can we detect abnormal health patterns, such as high heart rate during sleep?
  4. Is there a correlation between sleep duration and daily activity levels?
  5. How does activity level impact blood oxygen levels?
  6. Is there a correlation between stress levels and activity levels? What time of day do stress levels peak, and how does activity influence it?
  7. Can we detect potential health risks by analyzing low blood oxygen levels during high stress?
  
- **Action:** Use at least five graphs (line, bar, histogram, scatter, pie chart) to visualize your findings.

### 4. Project Summary and Conclusion
- **Action:** Summarize the findings and conclusions using Jupyter Notebook markdown cells and code cells.
- **Action:** Optionally, create PowerPoint slides to present your project.

## Timeline
- **3/5** - Start brainstorming the project idea and exploring the dataset.
- **3/25** - Submit the project proposal.
- **4/8, 4/22** - Mid-point project progress checking.
- **4/29** - Final presentation and project submission.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Dataset must have at least 5 columns and 500 rows.
- Ask a minimum of 5 questions about the dataset using various data manipulation techniques (insertion, deletion, update, extraction, grouping, aggregation, pivoting).
- Generate at least 5 different types of graphs (pie, line, bar, histogram, scatter).
- Use Jupyter Notebook markdown and code cells to conclude and present the analysis.
- Presentation quality and integrity of the project are key evaluation points.

## Current Status - **In Progress**
This project is in progress and is currently working through the following steps:
- Data collection and inspection from the Smartwatch Health Data dataset.
- Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis, including handling missing values and duplicates.
- Performing exploratory data analysis and generating visualizations.

Updates and progress will be tracked according to the workflow outlined above.

## Libraries Used
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and data manipulation.
- **Pandas**: For data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For advanced visualizations.

## License
This project is for educational purposes and adheres to the licensing terms of the Smartwatch Health Data dataset on Kaggle.
