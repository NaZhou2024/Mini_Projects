# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis on Smartwatch Health Data

🚀 Project Overview
This project applies exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to analyze and visualize smartwatch health data. The goal is to clean, prepare, analyze, and visualize data from a health dataset collected by a smartwatch, using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. 🧑‍💻

## 🧹 Data Cleaning and Preparation
Action:

💔 Handle missing values, duplicates, and invalid entries.

🔄 Merge datasets, delete unnecessary columns, add calculated columns, and perform date conversions.

## 🔍 Data Analysis and Visualization
Questions to Explore:

💓 How do heart rate variations correlate with different activities?

🩸 Does blood oxygen level fluctuate differently for active vs. sedentary individuals?

😴 Can we detect abnormal health patterns (e.g., high heart rate during sleep)?

🛌 Is there a correlation between sleep duration and daily activity levels?

🏃‍♂️ How does activity level impact blood oxygen levels?

😖 Is there a correlation between stress levels and activity levels?

⚠️ Can we detect potential health risks by analyzing low blood oxygen levels during high stress?


## 🔄 Current Status - In Progress

📚 Libraries Used
NumPy: 🔢 For numerical operations.
